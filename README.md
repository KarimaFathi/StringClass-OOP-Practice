# String Library

This library provides implementations of string manipulation functions based on exercises 22 to 44 from the `ProblemSolvingLevel3` repository.  
It includes a range of features such as:

- `join`
- `split`
- `find`
- `capitalize`
- `lower`
- `inverse`
- `punctuation removal`  
- and many more.

The project demonstrates a progression from functional programming techniques to an object-oriented programming (OOP) design.
